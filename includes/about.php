            <p class="sailecregular"> Hey there, my name's Eric and welcome to my portfolio website! I am currently on my 3rd year as a computer science major at Simon Fraser University in beautiful British Columbia. I've always 
                had a deep interest in technology and design and have found a beautiful way to combine the two through web development. During my time as a university student, I have become fascinated in building programs that are
                user-centric, intuitive, and functional. Some of my favourite languages to code in is HTML, CSS, and React. <br/><br/>

                When I'm not coding, you can usually find me playing video games such as The Sims, Planet Coaster, and Cities Skylines, listening to music, travelling, or playing with my dog. Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š
